## Solution Design and Validation Approach

### Iteration 1: Solution proposal and early evaluation


#### Study 1:

#### Study 2:


### Iteration 2: Solution refining and initial validation
#### Study 1:
#### Study 2:

### Iteration 3: Solution evolution and validation
#### Interview-based study for collecting the decision-making behind the selection of DT techniques in software development:
