## Problem Understanding Approach

### Exploratory studies

#### Literature mapping on Design Thinking in Software Development
+ [Article - Journal of System and Software (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222000024)

#### Survey with IT professionals on the use of Design Thinking in Software Development
+ [Conference Paper - XP 2020](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/39587/2020_Book_AgileProcessesInSoftwareEngine.pdf?sequence=1#page=81)

#### Meta-DT session for identifying a research problem

## Solution Design and Validation Approach

### Iteration 1: Solution proposal and early evaluation


<!-- #### Study 1: -->

<!-- #### Study 2: -->


### Iteration 2: Solution refining and initial validation
<!-- #### Study 1: -->
<!-- #### Study 2: -->

### Iteration 3: Solution evolution and validation
#### Interview-based study for collecting the decision-making behind the selection of DT techniques in software development:
